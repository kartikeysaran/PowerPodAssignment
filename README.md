# Android App Development Assignment

## Project Description
This Android mobile application allows users to authenticate using Google Sign-In and provides a feature to scan barcodes. Upon scanning a barcode and clicking the submit button, the app makes an API call to send the collected data to a server.

## Project Requirements

### Authentication Module
- Implement Google Sign-In functionality to allow users to log in with their Google accounts.

### Barcode Scanner Module
- Create a separate screen in the app where users can initiate barcode scanning.
- Implemented barcode scanning with Google MLKit library
- The scanned barcode data is displayed in Text box and a submit button on the screen. Users can submit the data to a server (POST request) by clicking the submit button.

### API Integration
- Used a Mock API using Beeceptor.com

## Tools and Libraries used 
Android Studio, Kotlin, DataBinding, MVVM Architecture, Hilt, and for the Mock API, I have used Beeceptor API (https://beeceptor.com).
